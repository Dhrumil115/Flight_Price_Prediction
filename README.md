# Flight_Price_Prediction
This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning models in predicting flight prices based on historical fare data. The models developed, particularly the Decision Tree, provide reliable predictions that can help customers find the best times to purchase tickets, ultimately making air travel more cost-effective.
